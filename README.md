# nfqueue-lab

This code is for the NFQueue live coding activity during the Linux Advanced Lab. Created in Fall 2019 Semester on 09/13/2019. 

It will be improved more soon with tags and releases, but by looking through the commits you can see code at different stages when coding the system. Obviously the only working solution is the final commit, but if you get confused during the live coding or want to see where you went wrong, take a look.
